# MIT SCX with Python
You'll find here various ways to use Python to solve Supply Chain Optimization problems

## Usage
open https://colab.research.google.com/, import the notebook from github and run the notebook :)

## SC0X 
SC0X_Python_Samples.ipynb shows some problems from SC0X course solved with Python and the [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) optimization library : Traveling Salesman Problem, Simple Network design, a statistical simulation of an inventory problem, ...

## SC1X 
SC0X_Python_Samples.ipynb shows some inventory problems from SC1X course solved with Python in particular a theorical solution for Multi-period Inventory Model and its simulation 

## SC2X 
SC2X_Python_Samples.ipynb shows some problems from SC2X course solved with Python with the Google OR-Tools Library, several network design problems of various complexity

## SCREAM challenge
The objective of the SCREAM challenge is to design a risk mitigation strategy to minimize total supply chain costs or maximize total supply chain profits while also maximizing the order fill rate (Service Level) over an uncertain future.
- SC3X-Scream1_MILP.ipynb showcases a first attempt using an advanced model of the objective function using MILP and the Google OR-Tools Library
- SC3X_Scream2_Hyper_parameter_optimization.ipynb showcases a second attempt using the [hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/) library
